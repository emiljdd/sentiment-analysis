There are less tweets posted during work hours and peaks at 8 PM onwards. Somehow, people still manage to be more active posting on Twitter during wee hours than during work hours. This seems to be the general trend though on any day of the week. 
Perhaps we can conjecture that since most people are busy during the day on their work, it's only after they hear from news about Wells Fargo, or checked their bank statement, or interact with Customer Service, or had any Wells Fargo related experience, that they would have the time to express their opinion or frustration on Twitter.

Based on our sample, more than half of the tweets are not positive (negative and neutral). This implies that there is a significant dissatisfaction with the Wells Fargo brand.

We sampled some of our neutral tweets. By clicking on the neutral segment, we are redirected to the samples belonging to that category. Some are actually advertisements or promotions. Since our analyzer is not perfect, there are some tweets here that we can assess as negative but categorized as neutral.

We also check the samples from positive. Some are news perhaps from Wells Fargo people or retweets from official Twitter handle of Wells Fargo, which obviously should be positive.
