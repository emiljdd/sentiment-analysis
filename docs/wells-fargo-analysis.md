# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Wells Fargo topic

## SUMMARY:
Wells Fargo went through a very publicized scandal that started gaining traction sometime in the fall of 2016. The CEO had to answer questions during a congressional probe and the overall outlook of the company was very bad on all fronts. A series of malpractices had been going on with the knowledge of the upper level management. The stock tanked, and all news concerning the bank was outright bad. Given this, one would think the bank would take a while to recover. This sentimental analysis was done in early March 2017. The number of tweets assessed were 2,502. The total users were 1,647. There were a total of 606 negative tweets and 1055 positive tweets based on certain word choices used when referring to "Wells Fargo". The neutral tweets were 841. This is a sample of only a week and for what it's worth this is a remarkable recovery given the seriousness of the issues the company had to deal with - and still are in many ways. The sum total is that though the scandal was damaging it has not had a long term effect on the outlook and future of Wells Fargo. The analysis says people will complain about practices of their banks but will not necessarily be easily moved as long as they provide the services they require. This is still a subjective analysis given the brevity of the research parameters or timeframe.

There are less tweets posted during work hours and peaks at 8 PM onwards. Somehow, people still manage to be more active posting on Twitter during wee hours than during work hours. This seems to be the general trend though on any day of the week. 
Perhaps we can conjecture that since most people are busy during the day on their work, it's only after they hear from news about Wells Fargo, or checked their bank statement, or interact with Customer Service, or had any Wells Fargo related experience, that they would have the time to express their opinion or frustration on Twitter.

Based on our sample, more than half of the tweets are not positive (negative and neutral). This implies that there is a significant dissatisfaction with the Wells Fargo brand.

We sampled some of our neutral tweets. By clicking on the neutral segment, we are redirected to the samples belonging to that category. Some are actually advertisements or promotions. Since our analyzer is not perfect, there are some tweets here that we can assess as negative but categorized as neutral.

We also check the samples from positive. Some are news perhaps from Wells Fargo people or retweets from official Twitter handle of Wells Fargo, which obviously should be positive.
